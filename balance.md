## Understanding Your Balance

### Current Balance
This is the total amount you owe on your credit card right now. It includes:
- All posted purchases
- Interest charges
- Fees
- Minus any payments or credits

### Available Credit
This is how much you can still spend. It's calculated as:
- Your credit limit minus your current balance
- Pending transactions also reduce available credit

### Statement Balance
This was your balance on your last statement date. Pay this amount by the due date to avoid interest on purchases.

### Minimum Payment
The smallest amount you must pay by the due date to keep your account in good standing. Usually the greater of:
- $10
- 3% of your balance

## Balance Update Timing

- Payments: Online payments credit within 1 business day
- Returns: Credits appear within 3-5 business days
